How to Host One HTML Page
===

 <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />


# Get one HTML page.

If you want one for practice, I recommend right-clicking on this one and hitting `View page source`.

If you're looking to _write_ a page like I did, well, I used [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [`pandoc`](https://pandoc.org/). That might be a bit much, though, maybe just go with this [straightforward "Convert Markdown to HTML" site](https://markdowntohtml.com/).

HTML is _not_ used to make things look pretty or to do programming stuff.

* If you want to make it look pretty, you use [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/What_is_CSS).
* If you want to add programming stuff later on, you use [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics)

# Get a [Github](https://github.com/) account.

Github is your Undo/Redo's big brother.

You don't need to know anything about that.

# On Github, start a [new repository](https://github.com/new).

Push the little + icon and click "New repository".



Name your repository something.

Ignore these. You do not need to "learn more". You are perfect as you are.

# Hit that _succulent_ "creating a new file" link.

![](Pasted image 20210620180645.png)

# Paste your HTML in there, _and name it `index.html`._

If you don't name it `index.html`, our later big boy Netlify won't know where to look.

# Commit that bad boy.
![](Pasted image 20210620182341.png)

You'll end up on a screen like this.

![](Pasted image 20210620182406.png)

If you check back on `index.html`, you'll suddenly see your code is all nice and well-formatted.

![](Pasted image 20210620182436.png)

**This is where you change things from now on**, with that little pencil.

Changes you make here will show up on your actual website a few seconds after you commit the change.

# 🖼 If you have images, put those in the repo too.

Like, for example, I'm going to have to put alllllllllllllll of these hot boys in there too, and probably several more once I'm done.

 Luckily, GitHub at least lets you drag and drop.

GitHub wasn't really made for hosting images, as can be seen by the fact that it takes a bit to upload, but I woke up today and chose violence. Nya.

# Get a [Netlify account](https://app.netlify.com/).

Okay, you might have heard about Github, but Netlify is some _real_ insider knowledge.

Somewhere in the world a computer needs to be on at all times to let you visit a website at all times.

We don't want to go through the hassle of setting up an entire multi-tiered VM infrastructure for our lil 🤏 site 🏠🏡🏠 on the World Wide Web 🕸🌐🥺👉🏻👈🏻. Although if you're ~ into ~ that kind of thing, [subscribe to my OnlySDNs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aquinn2/).

It's a business built off of exactly what we're doing here: Deploying static sites. They let us do a lot of basic stuff for free because they hope when we're rolling in Web shmoney we'll come back to them and use their paid stuff for Big Business™ things.

By the by, if you want to not have to write your next site in raw HTML, [consider a static site generator](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/14/what-is-a-static-site-generator-and-3-ways-to-find-the-best-one/). I know [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), although if I was going to start learning one from scratch I'd probably go with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) instead.


# Hit that _succulent_ ["New Site from Git" button](https://app.netlify.com/start).

![](Pasted image 20210620185053.png)

Since I already have a site on here, mine looks a little different.

But look! See that "Builds" list? Every time I changed `index.html`, senpai Netlify noticed me and automatically updated the [vot5.live](vot5.live) they were actually hosting on their servers.

# Wait a moment.

![](Pasted image 20210620190138.png)

# Check that link.

# WE DID IT

GO US WE'RE SO FUCKING COOL.

If nothing comes up, **double check that your HTML page was actually named `index.html` on Github.** This took me _minutes of my life_ to figure out. Don't be me. Choose life.

# 💸 Time to buy a domain name.

**The link that Netlify gives you will always work, and if you're happy with that stop here.**

But you do actually need to pay 💵💶💷 to get a domain name. Why? Remember when I said there has to be a computer on at all times to keep a Web site up, and that's why we used Netlify?

There are also [computers whose whole job is to remember who's who on the Internet](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-a-dns-server/),  and the tech involved in this is actually pretty tough. Someone somewhere needs to get paid to make sure you can actually go to [how-to-host-a-single-html.page](how-to-host-a-single-html.page).

# 💸 Go to [Hover](https://www.hover.com/) and buy a domain name.

![](Pasted image 20210620191102.png)

Hm, I wonder if -- oh, excellent.

![](Pasted image 20210620191130.png)

Mmm. That's kinda hard to read, though. Maybe some dashes?

![](Pasted image 20210620191206.png)

Perfect.

![](Pasted image 20210620191238.png)

Oh, if you see this, you should know Netlify _will_ encrypt your stuff by default, so this isn't really anything to worry about.

# ꙮ be not afraid ꙮ

# Go to the "DNS" tab.

![](Pasted image 20210620191700.png)

# Delete the first two "A" records.

You don't need them, they don't actually do anything.

![](Pasted image 20210620191735.png)

# Make an A record with Hostname `@`, and with IP address `75.2.60.5`.

For some reason, [Netlify makes it really hard to find that `75.2.60.5` number](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/custom-domains/configure-external-dns/). Probably because they'd prefer you use _their_ nifty little domain name service, but I woke up today and chose violence. Nya.

![](Pasted image 20210620192013.png)

```
🥺💬 "W-what's the @ for?"
🤠💬 The @ stands for your 'apex domain'.
😳💬 "W-what's an apex domain..."
🤠💭 jfc this kid's a dumbass
🤠💬 An 'apex domain' is just the website you bought without the www at the front. No I don't know why that makes a difference. It just does.
```

The `75.2.60.5` I _can_ explain a bit. That points to Netlify's "main load balancer", which is basically a steady, stable mask for an ever-changing sea of servers (and changing IP addresses) underneath it. 

# Make a CNAME record with Hostname `www`, and Value `wherever-the-fuck.netlify.app`.

![](Pasted image 20210620192847.png)

# Go back to your Netlify page and hit "Set up a custom domain".

![](Pasted image 20210620193043.png)

Yeah that's actually pretty normal, it takes Netlify a bit of time to get its certificate. Don't be intimidated.
